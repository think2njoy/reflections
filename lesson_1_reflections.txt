this course is good because it talks about git and github. 
rightnow they just showed how to see diffs between files. okay. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
we can go back to an earlier version anytime, without much difficulty. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: good for judgement n flexibility
cons: risks involved in relying on individual routines entirely

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It's because git is more programmer friendly :-) Well suited for developers -- not just software personnel but writers of novels as well. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat
git diff <first_id> <second_id>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because we can always revert back to one that works!

How Do You Want to Use Git?
for version control

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Test efficiency of code development.
