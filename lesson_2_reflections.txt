What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you initialize a repo, you get .git on your directory -- basically, it enables the files on this repo to be 
tracked / commited. You need to do that to maintain snapshots of changes in your repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
contents of the staging area can be directly committed to the repo, whereas the working directory 
contents need to be added to the staging area in the first place. 
staging area helps to add those file(s) that are done, so that you can decide when to commit or create a snapshot 
of the current state of repo in a more flexible manner.
