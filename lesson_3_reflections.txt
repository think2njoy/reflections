When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
so that we can work any time any where and with any one. cool isn't !!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there could be changes made by others that at least in some cases are not relevant to my work. 
so git-local automatically staying up to date with git-remote is not a good idea. 
hence, pulling changes manually i think should be the preferred mode.
